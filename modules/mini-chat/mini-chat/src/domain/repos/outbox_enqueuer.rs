/// Domain-layer abstraction for enqueuing outbox events within a transaction.

/// implements it by delegating to `modkit_db::outbox::Outbox::enqueue()`.
///
/// # Why a trait?
///
/// The `modkit_db::outbox::Outbox` API is partition-based and accepts raw
/// `Vec<u8>` payloads. Mini-Chat needs a domain-oriented interface that:
/// - Accepts typed events (from `mini-chat-sdk`; serialized by the implementation)
/// - Resolves the queue name and partition from tenant context
/// - Participates in the caller's transaction via `&dyn DBRunner`
/// - Returns domain errors, not infra-level `OutboxError`
///
/// # Implementation note
///
/// The infra implementation (`InfraOutboxEnqueuer`) holds an
/// `Arc<modkit_db::outbox::Outbox>` and calls `outbox.enqueue(runner, ...)`
/// within the finalization transaction. The `Outbox::flush()` notification
/// is sent after the transaction commits (by the finalization service).
